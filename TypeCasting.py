more about type casting:
1. Type casting is the process of converting a variable from one type to another.
2. In Python, you can use functions like int(), float(), and str() to perform type casting.
3. Type casting can be implicit or explicit.
4. Implicit type casting is done automatically by the interpreter.
5. Explicit type casting is done manually by the programmer.
6. Type casting can lead to loss of data if not done carefully.
7. Always check the type of a variable before performing operations on it.
